# grok-build-plugin: Grok Build for any coding agent

> Want Claude Code, Codex, or Cursor to drive Grok Build? If you already pay for a Grok subscription, this gives any of those agents live X search and data right in their context. A couple of ways to wire it up.

Bring **Grok Build's live X (Twitter) + web search** (and its coding agent) into the tools you already use. Two ways to consume it:

- **An MCP tool (`grok_search`)**: works in **any MCP-capable agent**: Claude Code, OpenAI Codex, Cursor, and others. This is the cross-agent, real-time-search core.
- **A Claude Code / Grok plugin**: convenience slash commands (`/grok:search`, `/grok:review`, `/grok:rescue`, and more) plus a delegation subagent, with the MCP tool auto-wired in.

Grok Build has native, real-time access to X and the web, strong for breaking news, social sentiment, current package/version facts, and anything where "what's true right now" matters, which a model's training cutoff can't provide. This project is a thin, auditable wrapper around your local `grok` CLI.

## What you get

- **`grok_search` MCP tool**: live X/web search with sources, callable autonomously by any MCP-capable agent (the cross-agent core)
- `/grok:search`: the same search as an explicit slash command
- `/grok:review`: a read-only Grok code review of your uncommitted changes or a branch
- `/grok:rescue`: delegate a coding/investigation task to Grok (write-capable)
- `/grok:status`, `/grok:result`, `/grok:cancel`: manage background jobs
- `/grok:setup`: verify Grok is installed and signed in
- a `grok:grok-rescue` subagent that Claude can hand substantial tasks to proactively

## Quick start: add `grok_search` to your agent

Works today in any MCP-capable agent, no install or publish step. You just need the [Grok Build CLI](https://docs.x.ai) signed in (`grok login`).

```jsonc
// drop into your agent's MCP config (see the per-agent table below for the path)
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "grok": { "command": "npx", "args": ["-y", "grok-build-x-search-mcp"] }
  }
}
```

Or one line for **OpenAI Codex**:

```bash
codex mcp add grok -- npx -y grok-build-x-search-mcp
```

Then just ask your agent to "search X for ..." and it will call `grok_search`. Verified live in Codex, Antigravity (`agy`), and Gemini CLI. Full per-agent paths are in [Per-agent setup](#per-agent-setup).

## Requirements

- **Grok Build CLI** installed and on your `PATH` as `grok` (or point `GROK_BIN` at it). Verify with `grok --version`.
- A signed-in Grok account (`grok login`). Usage counts toward your Grok limits.
- **Node.js 18.18 or later.**

## Install

Add the marketplace in Claude Code:

```bash
/plugin marketplace add nightwalker89/grok-build-plugin
```

Install the plugin:

```bash
/plugin install grok@grok-build-plugin
```

Reload plugins:

```bash
/reload-plugins
```

Then run:

```bash
/grok:setup
```

`/grok:setup` reports whether Grok is installed and authenticated. If it is installed but not signed in, run `!grok login` and rerun setup.

## Usage

### `/grok:search`: live X + web search

Grok's specialty. Answers questions using current information from X and the web, then lists its sources (including `x.com` post links when used).

```bash
/grok:search what are people on X saying about the new React release this week
/grok:search latest stable version of Node.js, with a source
/grok:search --background deep dive on recent X discussion of AI agent frameworks
```

Read-only: it only searches and reads; it never edits files.

### `/grok:review`: read-only code review

Runs a read-only Grok review of your current work. Grok will not modify any files.

```bash
/grok:review
/grok:review --base main
/grok:review --background look for race conditions in the new queue code
```

- Default target is your uncommitted changes. `--base <ref>` reviews the current branch against that ref.
- Any text after the flags becomes extra reviewer focus.
- Supports `--background` for large diffs.

### `/grok:rescue`: delegate a task to Grok

Hands a task to Grok through the `grok:grok-rescue` subagent. Write-capable by default.

```bash
/grok:rescue investigate why the integration tests started failing
/grok:rescue fix the failing test with the smallest safe patch
/grok:rescue --read-only diagnose the memory leak without changing code
/grok:rescue --resume-last apply the top fix from the last run
/grok:rescue --background --effort high refactor the database connection layer
```

- `--read-only` restricts Grok to reading/searching (no edits or shell).
- `--resume-last` continues the latest Grok task session in this repo; `--fresh` forces a new one. If you omit both, the plugin offers to continue when a resumable session exists.
- `--model <id>` and `--effort <low|medium|high>` are optional runtime controls.

You can also just ask in natural language, e.g. *"Ask Grok to redesign the retry logic to be more resilient,"* and Claude will route it to the subagent.

### `/grok:status`, `/grok:result`, `/grok:cancel`

```bash
/grok:status                # list running and recent jobs for this repo
/grok:result                # final output of the most recent completed job
/grok:result --job <id>     # a specific job
/grok:cancel                # cancel the most recent running job
```

`/grok:result` includes the Grok **session id** so you can reopen that run directly with `grok -r <session-id>` and continue it inside Grok.

## How it works

The plugin wraps the local `grok` CLI's **headless mode**:

```bash
grok -p "<prompt>" --output-format json
# → { "text": ..., "stopReason": ..., "sessionId": ..., "requestId": ... }
```

There is no separate server or daemon. Grok manages its own session store (under `~/.grok/sessions`), so:

- it uses the same Grok install and login you use directly,
- sessions started here can be resumed in the Grok TUI with `grok -r <id>` (and vice versa),
- read-only commands restrict Grok's toolset (`read_file`, `grep`, `list_dir`, `web_search`, `web_fetch`) so reviews and searches can't modify your repo.

Background jobs run the headless turn in a detached process, streaming output to a per-repository log under `~/.grok/cc-plugin/jobs/`. `/grok:status` and `/grok:result` read from there.

### Environment variables

| Variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `GROK_BIN` | Path to the `grok` binary if it isn't named `grok` on `PATH`. |
| `GROK_CC_STATE_DIR` | Override the background-job state directory (used by tests). |

## Use the search tool from any agent (MCP)

`grok_search` is a dependency-free MCP server (JSON-RPC over stdio). It runs straight from this repo with `npx`, so there's nothing to publish or build, and it's the same one repo as the plugin.

For Claude Code and Grok, the bundled plugin wires it up automatically. For any other MCP-capable agent, add this to its MCP config:

```jsonc
// OpenAI Codex (~/.codex/config.toml uses TOML; others use JSON like this)
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "grok": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "grok-build-x-search-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

Then the agent can call `grok_search(query)` on its own whenever it needs current information. It returns a synthesized answer plus a Sources list (including `x.com` links). The tool is read-only (Grok is restricted to `web_search`/`web_fetch`). It uses your local `grok` CLI, so you must have it installed and signed in.

### Per-agent setup

| Agent | How to add | Config location |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **OpenAI Codex** | `codex mcp add grok -- npx -y grok-build-x-search-mcp` | `~/.codex/config.toml` |
| **Gemini CLI** | add the JSON block above under `mcpServers` | `~/.gemini/settings.json` |
| **Antigravity (`agy`)** | add the JSON block above under `mcpServers` | `~/.gemini/config/mcp_config.json` (or workspace `.agents/mcp_config.json`) |
| **Cursor** | add the JSON block above | `~/.cursor/mcp.json` |
| **Claude Code / Grok** | install the plugin (auto-wired) | bundled `.mcp.json` |

Tested live with the `npx` launch (both `github:` during development and the published `grok-build-x-search-mcp`): **OpenAI Codex**, **Antigravity (`agy`)**, **Gemini CLI**, plus the standalone server handshake. Any other MCP client (Cursor, opencode, Copilot) uses the same JSON config.

### Why `npx grok-build-x-search-mcp` (preferred) or `npx github:...`

MCP clients resolve plugin paths differently. Claude Code and Grok substitute `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}`, but **Codex does not**, so a `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}`-based manifest fails there. Using the published package (`npx -y grok-build-x-search-mcp`) or `npx -y github:nightwalker89/grok-build-plugin` sidesteps all of it: npm hands every harness a correct absolute path, and the server resolves its own imports relative to itself (not the working directory). One manifest, every agent.

The published package on npm gives the fastest cold start (no git clone). The `github:` form still works as a fallback / for development and always points at the latest from the repo.

> Publishing the MCP server part to npm as `grok-build-x-search-mcp` (distinct from the plugin marketplace name) is now complete for v0.1.0+. The repo is `grok-build-plugin` on GitHub (was previously `grok-mcp`). The Claude/Grok *plugin* is installed via the marketplace using the repo name.

## Cross-harness: install in Grok too

This plugin follows the shared plugin spec, so it installs into **Grok Build** as a native plugin as well as into Claude Code. Grok reads Claude-format marketplaces, scans `~/.claude/skills/`, honors `~/.claude/settings.json`, and maps a plugin's `commands/` into its own skill/slash-command system. Verified with `grok plugin validate` and a full install cycle.

```bash
# Validate against Grok's plugin spec
grok plugin validate ./plugins/grok

# Install locally into Grok (trusts hooks/MCP)
grok plugin install ./plugins/grok --trust

# Or from a published repo / marketplace
grok plugin install nightwalker89/grok-build-plugin#plugins/grok --trust
grok plugin marketplace add nightwalker89/grok-build-plugin

grok plugin list          # confirm it's installed
grok inspect              # see its skills/agents/commands (tagged `plugin: grok`)
grok plugin uninstall grok --confirm
```

When installed, Grok surfaces the `grok-runtime` skill, the `grok-rescue` agent, and the `search`/`review`/`rescue`/`setup`/`status`/`result`/`cancel` commands.

> **Note:** the plugin's primary purpose is to bring Grok *into Claude Code*. Inside Grok itself, the search/review capabilities are largely native already, and the companion shells out to `grok -p` (a nested Grok run). Installing it in Grok is mainly useful for format parity and multi-harness/team marketplaces, delegating between Grok, Codex, and Gemini from whichever harness you're in.

## Development

```bash
npm test    # runtime unit tests + MCP server smoke tests (no Grok account needed)
```

The runtime lives in `plugins/grok/scripts/`:

- `grok-mcp.mjs`: the MCP server (source) exposing the `grok_search` tool (cross-agent; published separately to npm as grok-build-x-search-mcp)
- `grok-companion.mjs`: CLI dispatcher behind the slash commands
- `lib/grok.mjs`: headless `grok` invocation + result parsing (shared by both)
- `lib/jobs.mjs`: background-job tracking and log replay
- `lib/git.mjs`, `lib/prompts.mjs`, `lib/args.mjs`, `lib/render.mjs`, `lib/process.mjs`: supporting helpers

## FAQ

**Do I need a separate Grok account?**
No. The plugin uses your local `grok` CLI authentication. If you're already signed in (`grok login`), it works immediately.

**Does it use a separate Grok runtime?**
No. It delegates to your local `grok` CLI on the same machine, with the same auth, config, and repository checkout.

**Is the review really read-only?**
Yes. Review and search runs are restricted to read-only tools, so Grok cannot edit files or run shell commands during them. `/grok:rescue` is write-capable by default (use `--read-only` to restrict it).
